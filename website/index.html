			<h1>Let's talk about me.</h1>
			<p>
			Hi there! My name is Samantha and I am currently a Software Engineer at T-Mobile. I love musical theatre and avocados. I made this site, which is incredibly out of date. Woop!

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>At the BuildHer Hackathon this year, my team and I made a web app called Butterfl-eye, a communication service built to assist patients with ALS, Parkinson's, stroke or paralysis.. Using eye-tracking software, users are able to select messages in orer to commuincate their needs for others. Using Arduino, we also were able to attach a touch sensor that made noise and sound to notify others. We built this using the Web Gazer API for eye tracking To set up the keyboard, we used JavaScript, HTML, Python, and JQuery. I worked with a team member to adapt the API for our program. We won Best Hardware Hack AND Intel: Best Health & Wellness Hack Using Arduino 101 and/or Intel Edison. Pretty cool, huh? <br>
			Also, I made this website. Project inception? Not really, I guess.</p>
